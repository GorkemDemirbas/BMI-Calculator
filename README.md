This is a project which was given in the Microprocessors course of Ã‡ankaya University. In this project we are seperated by groups in my group which had 3 member with me. We choosed a project that calculates the BMI (Body Mass Index) of the user. As a group we looked how we can calculate the bmi value of the given user, and we saw that there was a formula on the web which calculates easily the bmi value of the desired person. In this project we used the TM4C123 microcontroller of Texas Instruments. In our project group everyone had different roles, and my duty was that after the calculation of the bmi value, searching of how can we use this bmi value. According to the BMI value we calculated, I set up an algorithm that illuminates the RGB LED on the microcontroller card and the RGB LED on the external board that works with it in different colors according to the calculated BMI value. For example, if the body mass index (BMI) is over 25, I created a warning system which shows the color of red in both microcontroller led and rgb led on the board, which means overweight. If it is over 35, it means obese, so I created a different warning system by quickly running purple and its color form by varying frequencies, which is showed that scale being broken. In this project, We used the assembly programming language, which was taught to us in the Microprocessors course and its labs, and which was also the language that they wanted us to do our project.
