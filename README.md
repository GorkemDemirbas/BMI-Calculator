This is a project that is given in the Microprocessors (EE 315) course of Ã‡ankaya University. In this project we are seperated by groups in my group which has a 3 member with me. We choosed a project that calculates the BMI (Body Mass Index) of the user. As a group we looked how can we calculate the bmi value of the given user and we saw that there is a formula that calculates easily the bmi value of the desired person. In this project we used the TM4C123 microcontroller. In this project everyone had a different roles, and my duty was that after the calculation of the bmi value, searching of how can we use this bmi value and I figured out that. I set up an algorithm that lights up the RGB LED on the microcontroller board and the RGB LED we connected to it simultaneously on the board, in different colors according to the BMI value we calculated. For example, if the body mass index (BMI) is over 25, I created a warning system with the color red, which means overweight. If it is over 35, it means overweight, so I created a separate warning system by quickly running purple and its shades at different frequencies, which will give the effect of the scale being broken. In this project, we used the assembly programming language, which was taught to us in the Microprocessors course and its labs, and which was also the language in which they wanted us to do our project.
