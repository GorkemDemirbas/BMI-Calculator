This is a project that is given in the Microprocessors (EE 315) course of Ã‡ankaya University. In this project we are seperated by groups in my group which had 3 member with me. We choosed a project that calculates the BMI (Body Mass Index) of the user. As a group we looked how we can calculate the bmi value of the given user, and we saw that there was a formula on the web which calculates easily the bmi value of the desired person. In this project we used the TM4C123 microcontroller of Texas Instruments. In our project group everyone had different roles, and my duty was that after the calculation of the bmi value, searching of how can we use this bmi value. I set up an algorithm that lights up the RGB LED on the microcontroller board and the RGB LED we connected to it simultaneously on the board, in different colors according to the BMI value we calculated. For example, if the body mass index (BMI) is over 25, I created a warning system with shown the color red in both microcontroller card and rgb led on the board, which means overweight. If it is over 35, it means obese, so I created a separate warning system by quickly running purple and its color form by varying frequencies, which was shown that scale being broken. In this project, we used the assembly programming language, which was taught to us in the Microprocessors course and its labs, and which was also the language in which they wanted us to do our project.
